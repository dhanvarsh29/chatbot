1. Download both the files(.csv and .ipynb)
2. Open the .ipynb with your notebook
3. In this line, df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/bhava/Downloads/ranchi_tourist_spots_full.csv") change the path as your csv file in your system.
4. Run the .ipynb file and youll get a link like this http://192....

   I have added the dependencies in the notebook file itself so just follow the instructions and run all the cells, and make sure this link stays activehttp://192....
